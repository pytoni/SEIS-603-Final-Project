# SEIS-603-Final-Project
This is my final project for the course SEIS 603 Foundations of Python I at Univeristy of St Thomas, Minnesota.
The project is about creating a Simple Point-of-Sale (POS) System.
The objective of this project is to help students to get familiar with all (mostly) Python basics and some advance concepts, which include the proper syntax, Python input/output, loops, lists, dictionaries, classes, objects, inheritance.
